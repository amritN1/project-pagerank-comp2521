# project-pagerank-comp2521

Personal project plus coding project of COMP2521. Basically is a program that imitates a simplified version of google's page rank algorithm. It calculates the page rank of a dummy url, for which there is a formula that outputs a number (ranking) from inputs of out-going and in-going links to the specific url. It then uses sorting algorithms to sort the urls in terms of highest ranking.
